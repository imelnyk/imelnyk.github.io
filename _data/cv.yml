  type: time_table
  contents:
    - title: Sequential Tabular Data
      description: Modeling and forecasting sequential data with a focus on event sequence modeling, anomaly and pattern detection, and graph-based representations of customer interactions.
    - title: Generative Models
      description: A broad class of machine learning algorithms that focuses on understanding the underlying data distribution and generate new samples with statistical properties similar to the original dataset.
    - title: Knowledge Graphs
      description: Automatic extraction of structured representations from text data, involving identifying entities, disambiguating their meanings, and mapping them to a graph-based representation for efficient storage, retrieval, and reasoning.
    - title: Protein Design
      description: Forward protein design predicts the structure and function of a protein based on its amino acid sequence, while the inverse design estimates a protein sequence with a desired structure and function.
    - title: Information Theory
      description: Information theoretic view of neural networks analyzing their properties to gain understanding on how they represent and process information, as well as for designing efficient architectures.
    - title: Image Captioning
      description: The task of analyzing the visual content of an image and generating a coherent and textual description that accurately describes the content of an image.
