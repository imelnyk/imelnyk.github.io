      institution: A broad class of machine learning algorithms that focuses on understanding the underlying data distribution and generate new samples with statistical properties similar to the original dataset.
      year: Generative Models
    - title:
      institution: Forward protein design predicts the structure and function of a protein based on its amino acid sequence, while the inverse design estimates a protein sequence with a desired structure and function.
      year: Protein Design
    - title:
      institution: Automatic extraction of structured representations from text data, involving identifying entities, disambiguating their meanings, and mapping them to a graph-based representation for efficient storage, retrieval, and reasoning.
